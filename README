Description: Experiments with Conway's Game of Life. The final objective
would be to create a whole playable game based on the Game of Life's rules.

Current state (21/3/2013): Simple board of GoL running on terminal with
hard-coded input. To run the code with different configurations it is needed
to change the defines for WIDTH and HEIGHT and manually create a configuration
using the matrix hardCodedInput in the gameOfLife's constructor.
The output needs you to press any key to go to the next state, but the output
board follows the rules correctly.
